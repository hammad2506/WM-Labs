The Fancycars folder is for Q1 and the system archtiecture pdf is for Q2.

Download Fancycars.
Run the following from terminal:  
  
-> npm install  (To install all the dependencies). 

-> npm run start-server (To start the node server on port 3000). 

-> npm run build (To build bundle.js). 

-> npm run dev-server  (To run the dev server for FE on port 8080).

(NOTE: If you are using MACOS and have updated to Mojave, by default all files starting with '.' will be hidden and .babelrc will not be accessible during build which will cause failure. Please make your system unhide .babelrc to successfully complete build.)
